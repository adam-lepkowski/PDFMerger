# PDFMerger

Merge up to five pdf files in chosen order into one. The frontend is handled by HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. Backend uses python and django. The file is stored on the server side and then served to the client with a http file response when ready to download. Merged file is stored indefinitely (cleanup as a future feature?).
